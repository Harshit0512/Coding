Modify both the strings such that all the common characters of s1 and s2 are to be removed and the uncommon characters of s1 and s2 are to be concatenated.
Note: If all characters are removed print -1

def concatenatedString(s,p):
    cms = set(s) & set(p)
    rst = []
    for i in s:
        if i not in cms:
            rst.append(i)
    for i in p:
        if i not in cms:
            rst.append(i)
    if len(rst) == 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return ''.join(rst)
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input()
    p = input()
    print(concatenatedString(s,p))
