A maximum number of 11 slices is attainable with 4 straight cuts.Assuming that after each slice cut we can not put all slice on top of each other.

However, even more slices are possible if the cuts do not all intersect.
look at  lazy caterer’s sequence
The "lazy caterer’s sequence" describes the maximum number of pieces of a circle that can be made with a given number of straight cuts.
The maximum number of pieces, p, that can be created with n cuts is given by the formula:

p = 1/2(n^2 + n + 2)

def check(n):
    p = 0.5*(n**2 + n + 2)
    return int(p)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(check(n))
